## Overview
### Description
Do you have random stuff taking up space in your house that still has some use? Are you looking for random itemâ€™s you see people just throwing out? Then Freebies is the app for you.

Freebies is a used item sharing app where users can sign up and post pictures of items that they want to give away and search for items other users are giving away.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** E-commerce / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** The primary usage platform for this app would be mobile because users can take a picture, upload it, and display the item they would like to trade. All of this could be done with their mobile device. The functionality could easily extend to a computer, but the mobile device is better suited because notifications will allow transactions to occur at a faster pace.
- **Story:**  Modern users want to clear up space and declutter. In addition, users want to be able to sift through a catalog of items so that they can find what they want without having to overspend. This interplay allows users to be donors/sellers and consumers on our
- **Market:** The market is far-ranging because e-commerce is a popular way people get to unload undesired items and load up on items they need or want.
- **Habit:** This app would be highly habit-forming because the UI/UX would make it easy for customers to see items that they are targeting but also pique their interests in other items. They could consistently upload the items they want to unload and keep track of them on the platform.
- **Scope:** Initially it would be individuals that are familiar with e-commerce platforms but over time we hope that the ease-of-use will help bring in those who are unfamiliar with e-commerce. Eventually we can facilitate this service to businesses that need to unload items.
